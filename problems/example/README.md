```typescript
# Longest Array in an Array of Arrays

## Problem Description

You are given an array of arrays, and your task is to find the longest array within the given array. In other words, you need to determine which sub-array has the maximum number of elements and return that sub-array.

## Input

- A two-dimensional array (array of arrays) where each inner array represents a list of elements. The input array can have any number of inner arrays, including zero.

## Output

- The longest array (sub-array) found within the input array.

## Example

**Input:**
```typescript
const inputArray = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8, 9],
    [10]
];
typescript```

**output:**
```typescript
[6, 7, 8, 9]
typescript```

### Constraints
* The elements in the input arrays can be of any data type (e.g., integers, strings, etc.).
* The input array can be empty, but it will always contain at least one inner array if not empty.
* If there are multiple arrays with the same maximum length, return the first one encountered.

## Function Signature
```typescript
function findLongestArray(arrays: any[][]): any[] {
    // Your TypeScript code here
}
typescript```
